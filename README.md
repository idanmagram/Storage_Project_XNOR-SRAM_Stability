This project explores the XNOR-SRAM architecture, an IMC solution proposed for binary/ternary neural networks, which integrates MVM functionality within SRAM bit-cells. Our goal was to analyse and mitigate physical design challenges such as Pull-Up/Pull-Down (PU/PD) resistance mismatch and spatial gradient variations, and to propose correction techniques that improve computational integrity without hardware modifications.
